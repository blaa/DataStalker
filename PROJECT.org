#+TITLE: Project notes

Project notes in org-mode format.

* A-level tasks
** TODO Stateful event aggregator
*** Events:
**** TODO New transmitter appears 
**** TODO Transmitter disappears (hysteresis)
**** TODO Transmitter is still active (periodical)

*** TODO Cheap event storage (ES-less for low-powered rpi)
    - I need a cheap perimeter monitoring (alarm like).

* B-level tasks
** TODO Initial state should return an object, not a dict.
   This object should gather information about the schema and have an API
   required by Elasticsearch to store the data.

** TODO Split packet parser and sniffer
   This is complicated by karmic hopper which needs some data on the sniffed
   packets.

   Pipelines could have an interface for passing messages "up" the pipeline.

** TODO PCAP source and test case based on this.

** TODO Separate sniffing thread with prn?
   Infinite loop with limit on packet count + time looks hacky.

** TODO Parallelization stage.
   Split data on hash into multiple parallel workers.

   - This might need a named pipelines idea (multiple named pipelines),
     single stage could redirect a message into a named pipeline

* C-level tasks
** Bluetooth source
** Simple ethernet, non-802.11, traffic metadata
** Migrate to my Config class from OrgAssist to early show config errors
